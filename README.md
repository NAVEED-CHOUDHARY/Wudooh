# Wudooh (وضوح)
Wudooh (clarity in Arabic and Persian) is a simple chrome extension 
that makes reading Arabic script clearer and easier.

Note that this project is still a work in progress.

This project is based on [Jackson Petty's](https://github.com/jopetty) 
[Huruf](https://github.com/jopetty/Huruf).

## Current Features
Wudooh will find any Arabic script text and update it to be in the more readable
[Noto Naskh Arabic](https://www.google.com/get/noto/#naskh-arab).

It will also update the text's size and line height to the user's choice from 100% to 200% larger.

## Future Features
* Whitelist websites
* More font options
