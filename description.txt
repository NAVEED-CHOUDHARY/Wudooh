Wudooh (clarity in Arabic and Persian) is a simple browser extension
that makes reading Arabic script text clearer and more pleasant.

Wudooh will update all Arabic script text across the browser and modify it according to the user's options.

Wudooh allows you to:
• Change Arabic text's font (from 35 fonts, including the no-font font lol)
• Change the font size from 100% (no change) to 200% larger
• Change the line height from 100% (no change) to 200% larger
• Whitelist websites from being changed by Wudooh

Wudooh will do all this automatically to any Arabic text, meaning even newly loaded content with
Arabic text will also update and become clearer.

This is not just for Arabic, but for any Arabic script, meaning this can work for Persian, Urdu and any other Arabic
script language.
